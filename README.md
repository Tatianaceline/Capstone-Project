![Images/Hospital Readmission Cycle](https://sensights.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-2.png)

This project develops a predictive model for patient readmission risk. By accurately identifying high-risk patients, hospitals and medical providers can better allocate resources and improve patient care, potentially reducing readmission rates and associated costs.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict the likelihood of patient readmission based on demographics, medical metrics, and hospital visit information.
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network
- **Accuracy Achieved**: Approximately 0.33 across models, indicating a consistent pattern for predicting readmission.

1. **Business Understanding**: Defines the project goals, including identifying key factors and addressing hospital management concerns.
2. **Data Understanding**: Describes the data sources, patient attributes, and target variable (`readmitted`).
3. **Data Cleaning**: Details data preparation steps, such as handling missing values and normalizing data.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes patterns and potential correlations among patient characteristics and readmission rates.
5. **Modeling and Evaluation**: Trains and evaluates three models to predict readmission, providing a robust baseline.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizes findings, including that each model identifies a 33% chance of readmission.

## Key Features
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalization of features for optimal model performance.
- **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)**: K-means clustering groups patients with similar characteristics, adding insights into high-risk categories.
- **Supervised Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network models predict the likelihood of readmission.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tatianaceline/Predictive-Model-for-Patient-Readmission-Risk.git
   
## Conclusion
The models developed demonstrate a 33% likelihood for predicting readmission risk, suggesting that specific patient characteristics and historical metrics significantly correlate with readmission likelihood. Further optimization and additional features could enhance prediction accuracy, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers.
