## Predicting Patient Readmission Risk

This project aims to build a predictive model for assessing patient readmission risk based on demographic and clinical data. Accurately identifying high-risk patients can enhance patient care quality and help healthcare providers manage costs associated with frequent readmissions.

Project Overview

Hospital readmissions are a significant healthcare challenge, impacting both patient well-being and operational costs. This project aims to identify key factors associated with readmission risk and develop a model that flags high-risk patients.

Key Questions
Which patient characteristics correlate with higher readmission risk?
How does hospital stay duration impact readmission likelihood?
Can a predictive model accurately forecast readmissions?
Dataset Description
The dataset includes patient demographic information, hospital visit details, and other clinical data, which are crucial for predicting readmission risk. The main features include:

patient_nbr: Unique patient identifier

gender: Patient gender

age: Age group of the patient

weight: Patient weight

time_in_hospital: Length of hospital stay

medical_specialty: Specialty of the primary care provider

num_lab_procedures: Number of lab tests during the stay

num_procedures: Number of procedures conducted

num_medications: Number of medications prescribed

number_outpatient: Number of outpatient visits

number_emergency: Number of emergency visits

number_inpatient: Previous inpatient admissions

number_diagnoses: Number of diagnoses

diabetesMed: Diabetes medication prescribed (yes/no)

readmitted: Target variable indicating if the patient was readmitted

Project Workflow

The project workflow includes the following stages:

Business Understanding: 
Define the healthcare challenges of readmissions.

Data Understanding: Understand the dataset and explore patterns.

Data Import and Library Setup: Load data and necessary libraries.

Data Cleaning: Prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify key patterns and correlations.

Modeling and Evaluation: Develop predictive models and evaluate their performance.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/Tatianaceline/Capstone-Project/edit/main/README.md
cd predicting-patient-readmission-risk
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the notebook to go through data analysis and model training steps.
To execute the model prediction on new data, adjust the data paths and run the cells for the trained model.
Results
The project evaluates multiple models to find the best fit for predicting readmission risk. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are used to compare models. The final model's performance will indicate its suitability for real-world application.

Conclusion

By identifying patients at high risk of readmission, healthcare providers can focus on targeted interventions to reduce the likelihood of readmissions, thereby improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resources.
